We O
propose O
a O
framework B
for O
using O
multiple O
sources O
of O
linguistic B
information I
in O
the O
task O
of O
identifying O
multiword B
expressions I
in O
natural B
language I
texts I
. O
We O
define O
various O
linguistically B
motivated O
classification B
features I
and O
introduce O
novel O
ways O
for O
computing O
them O
. O
We O
then O
manually O
define O
interrelationships B
among O
the O
features B
, O
and O
express O
them O
in O
a O
Bayesian B
network I
. O
The O
result O
is O
a O
powerful O
classifier B
that O
can O
identify O
multiword B
expressions I
of O
various O
types O
and O
multiple O
syntactic B
constructions I
in O
text B
corpora B
. O
Our O
methodology B
is O
unsupervised B
and O
language B
- I
independent I
; O
it O
requires O
relatively O
few O
language B
resources I
and O
is O
thus O
suitable O
for O
a O
large O
number O
of O
languages B
. O
We O
report O
results O
on O
English B
, O
French B
, O
and O
Hebrew B
, O
and O
demonstrate O
a O
significant O
improvement O
in O
identification B
accuracy B
