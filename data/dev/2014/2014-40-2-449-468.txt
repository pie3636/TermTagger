We propose a framework for using multiple sources of linguistic information in the task of identifying multiword expressions in natural language texts . We define various linguistically motivated classification features and introduce novel ways for computing them . We then manually define interrelationships among the features , and express them in a Bayesian network . The result is a powerful classifier that can identify multiword expressions of various types and multiple syntactic constructions in text corpora . Our methodology is unsupervised and language - independent ; it requires relatively few language resources and is thus suitable for a large number of languages . We report results on English , French , and Hebrew , and demonstrate a significant improvement in identification accuracy , compared with less sophisticated baselines .
