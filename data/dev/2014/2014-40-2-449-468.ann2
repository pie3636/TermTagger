We O
propose O
a O
framework O
for O
using O
multiple O
sources O
of O
linguistic O
information O
in O
the O
task O
of O
identifying O
multiword B
expressions I
in O
natural B
language I
texts I
. O
We O
define O
various O
linguistically O
motivated O
classification O
features O
and O
introduce O
novel O
ways O
for O
computing O
them O
. O
We O
then O
manually O
define O
interrelationships O
among O
the O
features O
, O
and O
express O
them O
in O
a O
Bayesian B
network I
. O
The O
result O
is O
a O
powerful O
classifier O
that O
can O
identify O
multiword B
expressions I
of O
various O
types O
and O
multiple O
syntactic O
constructions O
in O
text O
corpora O
. O
Our O
methodology O
is O
unsupervised O
and O
language O
- O
independent O
it O
requires O
relatively O
few O
language O
resources O
and O
is O
thus O
suitable O
for O
a O
large O
number O
of O
languages O
. O
We O
report O
results O
on O
English O
, O
French O
, O
and O
Hebrew O
, O
and O
demonstrate O
a O
significant O
improvement O
in O
identification O
accuracy O
