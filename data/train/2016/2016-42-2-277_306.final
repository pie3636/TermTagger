Most O
of O
the O

are O

still O
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
actually O

to O
some O

Thus O
, O
we O
propose O
three O

language B

approaches I
to O
source B
language I
adaptation I
for O
resource B

poor I

translation I
. O
Specifically O
, O
we O
build O
improved O
statistical B
machine I
translation I
models I
from O
a O
resource B
- I
poor I
language I
POOR B
into O
a O
target B
language I
TGT I
by O
adapting B
and O
using O
a O
large B

for O
a O
related B
resource I
- I
rich I
language I
RICH I
and O
the O
same O
target B

TGT B
. O
We O
assume O
a O
small B
POOR I

from O
which O
we O
learn O

Our O
work O
is O
of O
importance O
for O
resource B

poor I

because O
it O
can O
provide O
a O
useful O

for O

Our O
experiments O
for O
Indonesian O

English O
translation O
show O
that O
using O
the O
large B
adapted I
resource I

rich I
bitext I
yields O
7.26 O
BLEU B
points O
of O
improvement O
over O
the O

and O
3.09 O
BLEU B
points O
over O
the O

Moreover O
, O
combining O
the O
small B
POOR I

TGT I
bitext I
with O
the O

outperforms O
the O
corresponding O

with O

by O
1.93–3.25 O

We O
also O
demonstrate O
