We O

The O
availability O
of O
large O
training B
data I
sets I
that O
grow O
constantly O
over O
time O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
frequent O
in O
the O
field O
of O
SMT B
â€” O
for O
example O
, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
translation B
agencies I
or O
the O

When O
new O
knowledge O
is O
to O
be O
incorporated O
in O
the O
SMT B
models I
, O
the O
use O
of O
batch B
learning I
techniques O
require O
very O
time O
- O
consuming O
estimation O
processes O
over O
the O
whole O
training B
set I
that O
may O
take O
days O
or O
weeks O
to O
be O
executed O
. O
By O
means O
of O
the O
application O
of O
online O
learning O
, O
new O
training B
samples I
can O
be O
processed O
individually O
in O
real O
time O
. O
For O
this O
purpose O
, O
we O
define O
a O
state B

of I

the I
- I
art I
SMT B
model I
composed O
of O
a O
set O
of O
submodels B
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
set O
of O
incremental B
update I
rules O
for O
each O
of O
these O
submodels B
. O
To O
test O
our O
techniques O
, O
we O
have O
studied O
two O
well O
- O
known O
SMT B
applications O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
translation B
agencies I
: O
post B
- I
editing I
and O
interactive B
machine I
translation I
. O
In O
both O
scenarios O
, O
the O
SMT B
system I
collaborates O
with O
the O
user O
to O
generate O
high O
- O
quality O
translations B
. O
These O
user B
- I
validated I
translations I
can O
be O
used O
to O
extend O
the O
SMT B
models I
by O
means O
of O
online O
learning O
. O
Empirical B
results I
in O
the O
two O
scenarios O
under O
consideration O
show O
the O
great O
impact O
of O
frequent O
updates O
in O
the O
system O
performance O
. O
The O
time O
cost O
of O
such O
updates O
was O
also O
measured O
, O
comparing O
the O
efficiency O
of O
a O
batch B
learning I
SMT I
system I
with O
that O
of O
an O
online O
learning O
system O
, O
showing O
that O
online O
learning O
is O
able O
to O
work O
in O
real O
time O
whereas O
the O
time O
cost O
of O
batch B
retraining I
soon O
becomes O
infeasible O
. O
Empirical B
results I
also O
showed O
that O
the O
performance O
of O
online O
learning O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
batch B
learning I
. O
Moreover O
, O
the O
proposed O
techniques O
were O
able O
to O
learn B
from O
previously O
estimated O
models O
or O
from O
scratch O
. O
We O
also O
propose O
two O
new O
measures O
to O
predict O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
online O
learning O
in O
SMT B
tasks I
. O
The O
translation B
system I
with O
online O
learning O
capabilities O
presented O
here O
is O
