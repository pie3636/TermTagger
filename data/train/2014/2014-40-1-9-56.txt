Frame semantics is a linguistic theory that has been instantiated for English in the FrameNet lexicon . We solve the problem of frame - semantic parsing using a two - stage statistical model that takes lexical targets ( i.e. , content words and phrases ) in their sentential contexts and predicts frame - semantic structures . Given a target in context , the first stage disambiguates it to a semantic frame . This model uses latent variables and semi - supervised learning to improve frame disambiguation for targets unseen at training time . The second stage finds the target 's locally expressed semantic arguments . At inference time , a fast exact dual decomposition algorithm collectively predicts all the arguments of a frame at once in order to respect declaratively stated linguistic constraints , resulting in qualitatively better structures than na√Øve local predictors . Both components are feature - based and discriminatively trained on a small set of annotated frame - semantic parses . On the SemEval 2007 benchmark data set , the approach , along with a heuristic identifier of frame - evoking targets , outperforms the prior state of the art by significant margins . Additionally , we present experiments on the much larger FrameNet 1.5 data set . We have released our frame - semantic parser as open - source software .
