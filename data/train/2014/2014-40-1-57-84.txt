Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) systems automatically choose the intended meaning of a word in context . In this article we present a WSD algorithm based on random walks over large Lexical Knowledge Bases ( LKB ) . We show that our algorithm performs better than other graph - based methods when run on a graph built from WordNet and eXtended WordNet . Our algorithm and LKB combination compares favorably to other knowledge - based approaches in the literature that use similar knowledge on a variety of English data sets and a data set on Spanish . We include a detailed analysis of the factors that affect the algorithm . The algorithm and the LKBs used are publicly available , and the results easily reproducible .
