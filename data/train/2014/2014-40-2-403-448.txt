Linguistic steganography is concerned with hiding information in natural language text . One of the major transformations used in linguistic steganography is synonym substitution . However , few existing studies have studied the practical application of this approach . In this article we propose two improvements to the use of synonym substitution for encoding hidden bits of information . First , we use the Google n - gram corpus for checking the applicability of a synonym in context , and we evaluate this method using data from the SemEval lexical substitution task and human annotated data . Second , we address the problem that arises from words with more than one sense , which creates a potential ambiguity in terms of which bits are represented by a particular word . We develop a novel method in which words are the vertices in a graph , synonyms are linked by edges , and the bits assigned to a word are determined by a vertex coding algorithm . This method ensures that each word represents a unique sequence of bits , without cutting out large numbers of synonyms , and thus maintains a reasonable embedding capacity .
