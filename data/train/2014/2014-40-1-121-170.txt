What is here called controlled natural language ( CNL ) has traditionally been given many different names . Especially during the last four decades , a wide variety of such languages have been designed . They are applied to improve communication among humans , to improve translation , or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations . Despite the apparent differences , it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella . To bring order to the variety of languages , a general classification scheme is presented here . A comprehensive survey of existing English - based CNLs is given , listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today . Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other . The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL , to contribute to the understanding of their general nature , to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area , and to help developers to make design decisions .
