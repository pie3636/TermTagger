Recent research has shown clear improvement in translation quality by exploiting linguistic syntax for either the source or target language . However , when using syntax for both languages ( “ tree - to - tree ” translation ) , there is evidence that syntactic divergence can hamper the extraction of useful rules ( Ding and Palmer 2005 ) . Smith and Eisner ( 2006 ) introduced quasi - synchronous grammar , a formalism that treats non - isomorphic structure softly using features rather than hard constraints . Although a natural fit for translation modeling , its flexibility has proved challenging for building real - world systems . In this article , we present a tree - to - tree machine translation system inspired by quasi - synchronous grammar . The core of our approach is a new model that combines phrases and dependency syntax , integrating the advantages of phrase - based and syntax - based translation . We report statistically significant improvements over a phrase - based baseline on five of seven test sets across four language pairs . We also present encouraging preliminary results on the use of unsupervised dependency parsing for syntax - based machine translation .
