Authorship attribution deals with identifying the authors of anonymous texts . Traditionally , research in this field has focused on formal texts , such as essays and novels , but recently more attention has been given to texts generated by on - line users , such as e - mails and blogs . Authorship attribution of such on - line texts is a more challenging task than traditional authorship attribution , because such texts tend to be short , and the number of candidate authors is often larger than in traditional settings . We address this challenge by using topic models to obtain author representations . In addition to exploring novel ways of applying two popular topic models to this task , we test our new model that projects authors and documents to two disjoint topic spaces . Utilizing our model in authorship attribution yields state - of - the - art performance on several data sets , containing either formal texts written by a few authors or informal texts generated by tens to thousands of on - line users . We also present experimental results that demonstrate the applicability of topical author representations to two other problems : inferring the sentiment polarity of texts , and predicting the ratings that users would give to items such as movies .
