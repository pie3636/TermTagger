The written form of the Arabic language , Modern Standard Arabic ( MSA ) , differs in a non - trivial manner from the various spoken regional dialects of Arabic — the true “ native languages ” of Arabic speakers . Those dialects , in turn , differ quite a bit from each other . However , due to MSA 's prevalence in written form , almost all Arabic data sets have predominantly MSA content . In this article , we describe the creation of a novel Arabic resource with dialect annotations . We have created a large monolingual data set rich in dialectal Arabic content called the Arabic On - line Commentary Data set ( Zaidan and Callison - Burch 2011 ) . We describe our annotation effort to identify the dialect level ( and dialect itself ) in each of more than 100000 sentences from the data set by crowdsourcing the annotation task , and delve into interesting annotator behaviors ( like over - identification of one 's own dialect ) . Using this new annotated data set , we consider the task of Arabic dialect identification : Given the word sequence forming an Arabic sentence , determine the variety of Arabic in which it is written . We use the data to train and evaluate automatic classifiers for dialect identification , and establish that classifiers using dialectal data significantly and dramatically outperform baselines that use MSA - only data , achieving near - human classification accuracy . Finally , we apply our classifiers to discover dialectical data from a large Web crawl consisting of 3.5 million pages mined from on - line Arabic newspapers .
