To	O

this	O

we	O
first	O
devise	O
a	O
hierarchical	B
alignment	I
scheme	I
where	O
Chinese	O
and	O
English	O
parse	B
trees	I
are	O
aligned	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
eliminates	O
conflicts	O
and	O
redundancies	O
between	O
word	B
alignments	I
and	O
syntactic	B
parses	I
to	O
prevent	O
the	O

we	O
are	O

to	O

identify	O

the	O

between	O
the	O
two	O
languages	O

quantify	O
each	O
type	O

translation	B

Our	O
results	O
show	O
that	O
the	O
translation	B

are	O
much	O
broader	O
than	O

in	O
previous	O
studies	O
that	O
are	O

evidence	I

linguistic	B

The	O
distribution	B

the	O

shows	O
that	O
some	O
high	B

translation	B

that	O

research	O
are	O
actually	O

other	O
translation	B

exist	O
in	O

We	O
also	O
show	O
that	O
HACEPT	B
allows	O
the	O
extraction	B
of	O
syntax	B

based	I
translation	B
rules	I

most	O
of	O
which	O
are	O
expressive	O
enough	O
to	O
capture	O
the	O
translation	B

and	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
syntactic	B
annotation	I
in	O
existing	O
treebanks	B
is	O
not	O
optimal	O
for	O
extracting	B
such	O
translation	B

We	O
also	O
discuss	O
the	O
implications	O
of	O
our	O
study	O
for	O
attempts	O
to	O
bridge	O
translation	B

by	O
devising	O

Our	O

the	O
observation	O
that	O

it	O
