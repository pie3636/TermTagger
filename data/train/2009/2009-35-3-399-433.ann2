Many	O
approaches	O
to	O
automatic	B
sentiment	B
analysis	B
begin	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
lexicon	B
of	O
words	B
marked	O
with	O
their	O
prior	O
polarity	B
(	O
also	O
called	O
semantic	B

)	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
contextual	B
polarity	B
of	O
the	O
phrase	B
in	O
which	O
a	O
particular	O
instance	B
of	O
a	O
word	B
appears	O
may	O
be	O
quite	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
word	B

prior	O
polarity	B

Positive	B

in	O
phrases	B

quite	O
often	O
words	B

The	O
goal	O

this	O
work	O
is	O
to	O
automatically	B
distinguish	O
between	O
prior	B

contextual	B
polarity	B

with	O
a	O
focus	O
on	O
understanding	O
which	O

important	O
for	O
this	O
task	I

Because	O
an	O
important	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
identifying	O
when	O
polar	B
terms	I
are	O
being	O
used	O
in	O
neutral	B
contexts	B
,	O
features	B
for	O
distinguishing	O
between	O
neutral	B

polar	B
instances	I
are	O
evaluated	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
features	B
for	O
distinguishing	O
between	O
positive	B
and	O
negative	B
contextual	B
polarity	B

The	O
evaluation	O
includes	O
assessing	O
the	O
performance	O
of	O
features	B

For	O
all	O

one	O

the	O

Another	O
facet	O
of	O
the	O
evaluation	O
considers	O
how	O
the	O
presence	O

affects	O
the	O
performance	O
of	O
features	B
for	O
distinguishing	O

polarity	B

These	O
experiments	O

that	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
neutral	B

greatly	O
degrades	O
the	O
performance	O

these	O

that	O
perhaps	O
the	O

way	O
