The	O
article	O
describes	O
a	O
pilot	O
implementation	O
of	O
a	O
grammar	O
containing	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
locative	O
PPs	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
we	O
investigate	O
the	O
distinction	O
between	O
static	O
and	O
directional	O
locatives	O
,	O
and	O
between	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
directional	O
locatives	O
.	O

Locatives	O
may	O
act	O
as	O
modifiers	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
referring	O
expressions	O
depending	O
on	O
the	O
syntactic	O
context	O
.	O

We	O
handle	O
this	O
with	O
a	O
single	O
lexical	O
entry	O
.	O

The	O
implementation	O
is	O
of	O
Norwegian	O
locatives	O
,	O
but	O
English	O
locatives	O
are	O
both	O
discussed	O
and	O
compared	O
to	O
Norwegian	O
locatives	O
.	O

The	O
semantic	O
analysis	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
proposal	O
by	O
Markus	O
Kracht	O
(	O

,	O
and	O
we	O
show	O
how	O
this	O
analysis	O
can	O
be	O
incorporated	O
into	O

We	O

how	O
