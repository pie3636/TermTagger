This	O
article	O
describes	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
computational	O
models	O
of	O
spatial	O
prepositions	O
to	O
visually	O
situated	O
dialog	O
systems	O
.	O

In	O
these	O
dialogs	O
,	O
spatial	O
prepositions	O
are	O
important	O
because	O
people	O
often	O
use	O
them	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
entities	O
in	O
the	O
visual	O
context	O
of	O
a	O
dialog	O
.	O

We	O
first	O
describe	O
a	O
generic	O
architecture	O
for	O
a	O
visually	O
situated	O
dialog	O
system	O
and	O
highlight	O
the	O
interactions	O
between	O
the	O
spatial	O
cognition	O
module	O
,	O
which	O
provides	O
the	O
interface	O
to	O
the	O
models	O
of	O
prepositional	O
semantics	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
components	O
in	O
the	O
architecture	O
.	O

Following	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
present	O
two	O
new	O
computational	O
models	O
of	O
topological	O
and	O
projective	O
spatial	O
prepositions	O
.	O

The	O
main	O
novelty	O
within	O
these	O
models	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
account	O
for	O
the	O
contextual	O
effect	O
which	O
other	O
distractor	O
objects	O
in	O
a	O
visual	O
scene	O
can	O
have	O
on	O
the	O
region	O
described	O
by	O
a	O
given	O
preposition	O
.	O

We	O
next	O
present	O
psycholinguistic	O
tests	O
evaluating	O
our	O
approach	O
to	O
distractor	O
interference	O
on	O
prepositional	O
semantics	O
,	O
and	O
illustrate	O
how	O
these	O
models	O
are	O
used	O
for	O
both	O
interpretation	O
and	O
generation	O
of	O
prepositional	O
expressions	O
