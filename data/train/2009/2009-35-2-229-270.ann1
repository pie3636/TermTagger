The	O
article	O
describes	O
a	O
pilot	O
implementation	B
of	O
a	O
grammar	B
containing	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
locative	B
PPs	B

In	O
particular	O
,	O
we	O
investigate	O
the	O
distinction	O
between	O
static	B
and	O
directional	B
locatives	B
,	O
and	O
between	O
different	O
types	O
of	O
directional	B
locatives	B
.	O

Locatives	B
may	O
act	O
as	O
modifiers	B
as	O
well	O
as	O
referring	B
expressions	B
depending	O
on	O
the	O
syntactic	B
context	B
.	O

We	O
handle	O
this	O
with	O
a	O
single	O
lexical	B
entry	B

The	O
implementation	B
is	O
of	O
Norwegian	B
locatives	B

English	B
locatives	B
are	O
both	O
discussed	O
and	O
compared	O
to	O
Norwegian	B
locatives	B

The	O
semantic	B
analysis	I
is	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
proposal	I
by	O
Markus	O
Kracht	O
(	O

we	O

how	O
this	O
