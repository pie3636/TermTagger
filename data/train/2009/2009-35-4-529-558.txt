There	O
is	O
growing	O
interest	O
in	O
using	O

to	O
evaluate	O
Natural	O

systems	O

because	O
these	O
are	O
often	O
considerably	O

than	O
the	O
human	O

which	O

We	O
review	O

on	O
NLG	O

on	O
validation	O
of	O
automatic	O
metrics	O

then	O
present	O
the	O
results	O

two	O

how	O
well	O
some	O
metrics	O
which	O
are	O
popular	O
in	O

areas	O

NLP	O
(	O

BLEU	O

Our	O
results	O
suggest	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
this	O
domain	O
,	O
metrics	O
may	O
provide	O
a	O
useful	O
measure	O
of	O

quality	O

although	O
the	O
evidence	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
ideally	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
not	O

We	O
also	O
discuss	O
a	O
