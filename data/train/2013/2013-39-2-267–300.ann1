The	O
most	B

approaches	I
for	O
evaluation	B
of	O

follow	O
some	O
protocol	B
for	O
comparing	B
a	I

human	B
summaries	I

which	O
are	O
traditionally	O
called	O
model	B
summaries	I

This	O
evaluation	B
paradigm	I
falls	O
short	O
when	O
human	B
summaries	I
are	O
not	O

and	O
becomes	B

when	O
only	O
a	O

We	O
propose	O
three	O
novel	B
evaluation	I
techniques	I

Two	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
model	B
-	I
free	I
and	O
do	O
not	O
rely	B
on	I
a	I
gold	I
standard	I
for	I
the	I
assessment	I

The	O
third	O
technique	O
improves	B
standard	I
automatic	I
evaluations	I
by	O
expanding	B
the	I
set	I
of	I
available	I
model	I
summaries	I
with	O

system	I

We	O
show	O
that	O
quantifying	B
the	I
similarity	I
between	I
the	O
source	B
text	I
and	O
its	O
summary	B
with	O
appropriately	O
chosen	B
measures	I
produces	O
summary	B
scores	I
which	O
replicate	B
human	I
assessments	I

We	O
also	O
explore	B
ways	I
of	O
increasing	B
evaluation	I
quality	I
when	O
only	O
one	O
human	B
model	I
summary	I
is	O
available	O
as	O
a	O
gold	B
standard	I

We	O
introduce	O
pseudomodels	B

which	O
are	O
system	B
summaries	I
deemed	O
to	O
contain	B
good	I
content	I
according	B
to	I
automatic	I
evaluation	I

Combining	O
the	O
pseudomodels	B
with	O
the	O
single	B
human	I
model	I
to	B
form	I
the	I
gold	I

leads	O

Finally	O

we	O
explore	B
the	I

another	I

similarity	I
between	O
a	O
system	B

the	O
