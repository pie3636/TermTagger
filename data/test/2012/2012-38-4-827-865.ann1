This    O
article    O
deals    O
with    O
deverbal    B
nominalizations    I
in    O
Spanish    O
;    O
concretely    O
,    O
we    O
focus    O
on    O
the    O
denotative    B
distinction    I
between    O
event    B
and    O
result    B
nominalizations    I
.    O
The    O
goals    O
of    O
this    O
work    O
is    O
twofold    O
:    O
ﬁrst    O
,    O
to    O
detect    O
the    O
most    O
relevant    B
features    I
for    O
this    O
denotative    B
distinction    I
;    O
and    O
,    O
second    O
,    O
to    O
build    O
an    O
automatic    B
classiﬁcation    I
system    I
of    O
deverbal    B
nominalizations    I
according    O
to    O
their    O
denotation    B
.    O
We    O
have    O
based    O
our    O
study    O
on    O
theoretical    B
hypotheses    I
dealing    O
with    O
this    O
semantic    B
distinction    I
and    O
we    O
have    O
analyzed    O
them    O
empirically    O
by    O
means    O
of    O
Machine    B
Learning    I
techniques    I
which    O
are    O
the    O
basis    O
of    O

This    O
is    O
the    O
ﬁrst    O
tool    O
that    O
aims    O
to    O
automatically    O
classify    O
deverbal    B
nominalizations    I
in    O
event    O
,    O
result    O
,    O
or    O
underspeciﬁed    B

types    O
in    O
Spanish    O
.    O
The    O
ADN    B
-    I
Classiﬁer    I
has    O
helped    O
us    O
to    O
quantitatively    O
evaluate    O
the    O
validity    O
of    O
our    O
claims    O
regarding    O
deverbal    B
nominalizations    I
.    O
We    O
set    O
up    O
a    O
series    O
of    O
experiments    O
in    O
order    O
to    O
test    O
the    O
ADN    B
-    I
Classiﬁer    I
with    O
different    O
models    O
and    O
in    O
different    O
realistic    O
scenarios    O
depending    O
on    O
the    O
knowledge    B
resources    I
and    O
natural    B
language    I
processors    I
available    O
.    O
The    O
